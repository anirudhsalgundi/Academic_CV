\item[]  \hspace{-1em} \textbf{``Thermonuclear bursts in Neutron Star Low Mass X-ray Binaries"}
\item Studying a sample of 15 thermonuclear X-ray Bursts from two transient Low Mass X-ray Binary sources 4U\:1728--34 \& 4U\:1735--44 using \textit{AstroSat} data.
\item Developed pipelines for basic data reduction, time-resolved burst spectral analysis, and timing analysis for exploring accretion phenomena and rapid variability in lightcurves.
